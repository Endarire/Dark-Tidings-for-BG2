DON'T DEPEND TOO MUCH ON ANYONE IN THIS WORLD, BECAUSE EVEN YOUR OWN SHADOW LEAVES YOU WHEN YOU ARE IN DARKNESS.

*For thousands of years, the magical light of the Sea Tower of Irphong has been a steady guide for sailors making their passage through Asavir's Channel - until now, because the light of the Sea Tower has extinguished. There have long been rumors of pirates using the island as a hideout, as well as Dragon Turtles and Kraken that have made the shallows around the island their home. There is only one way to uncover the secret behind the darkness of the Sea Tower: You must sail to the island and search for the cause of the extinguished beacon.*

Dark Tidings is a quest mod for Baldur's Gate II. It starts in the docks district of Athkatla (in the tavern Sea's Bounty) and is playable right from the beginning of the SoA part of the trilogy.

Key features:
- New areas to discover, completely designed in 3D from scratch
- New monsters to defeat
- New treasure to recover
- Estimated playing time: 1-2 hours
- Languages: English, German

You do not need to start a new game to start the quest of this mod. The Mod is intended for a well-balanced party of levels 9-12. To complete some of the optional components you will need either a mage, bard, cleric, shaman, sorcerer or druid in your party.

The adventure is based on descriptions from the "Lands of Intrigue" sourcebook by Steven E. Schend and inspired by the adventure "The Darkhouse of Saerloon" (from _Faiths and Pantheons_) by Eric L. Boyd and Eric Mona.

Dark Tidings is compatible with the following versions of Baldur's Gate II:

- BG2 - ToB (the original-non-EE-Version)
- BG2EE - the Enhanced-Edition version of Baldur's Gate 2
- Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)
- Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET) - not tested yet

Please note that there are different installation requirements for the different versions of the game. See the PDF documentation for details.
