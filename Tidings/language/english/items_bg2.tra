@2000 = ~The Ring of Purest Blood~
@2001 = ~Achieving lichdom is no easy task, and many aspiring undead mages have failed miserably in their attempt to attain eternal life. The mage Arcturus of Shoonach sought to prevent this failure by creating this ring. He bound the blood of three storm giants into the ring and had a dwarven gemstone cutter work in a ruby as an ornament. The effort was rewarded with this ring, which he hoped would protect him from the all-too-deadly effects of drinking the poisonous brew needed to attain lichdom.

A few days later, a priest of Kelemvor pulled the ring from Arcturus' cold fingers before he was buried in the mausoleum. Even if the ring had not worked as intended for its creator, it served the Church of Ilmater well in the centuries to come, which used the object to help the sick and dying recover more quickly from their ailments. From then on, it was the task of the item to serve the well-being of the peoples of Faerun. To this day, the ring is a symbol of purity, health and vitality and is sought and coveted by many for a variety of reasons, though no one has been foolish enough to use the ring again in a ritual as powerful as achieving lichdom.

@2004 = ~This cloak is dark and sinister.~
@2005 = ~This cloak is woven of thick, old linen that seems strangely frayed at its edges - much as if the outline of the cloak is fading from this world. It offers protection against many types of elemental damage and conventional attacks, but the wearer must pay a high price for it: If he fails a Death saving throw, he dies trying to don the cloak. If the saving throw succeeds, however, he still loses some of his life force.
  The cloak smells of damp, gloomy earth and seems to be very old - perhaps it dates from a time when even the gods of the realms were still young and other, more primal beings ruled over Toril. The history of the garment is as obscure as the wearer of the cloak itself.

You were given it by the undead lighthouse keeper, who asked you to use the book to perform a ritual to seal the portal to the Plane of Shadow and shut down the unholy place beneath the lighthouse. The book contains a passage on how to perform the ritual:
  "To banish the influence of the Elder Elemental Eye, the evil Tharizdun, from the World of Light, a user of arcane or divine magic must proceed as follows. At the place under the lighthouse where Tharizdun's whispers can be heard and the twisted elemental magic is in effect, the ritual must be performed.
First, the luminous crystal must be placed beneath the unholy altar. An expert in magic must stand in the middle of the room. It is irrelevant whether the magic caster is a mage or a priest. The first spell the caster has to cast is 'Protection from Evil' to keep the evil elements away from the place. The second spell to be cast is 'True Sight' to remove the evil illusions of Tharizdun. As a final spell, the ritualist must cast 'Dispel Magic' to break the magical bonds that feed the unholy place with energy. Then the ritual is performed and the dark whispers of Tharizdun will be forever silenced beneath the lighthouse. It may be that the Luminous Crystal will be destroyed by the ritual, but this is the sacrifice necessary to banish the dark evil of Tharizdun from the world of light once more."~
@2020 = ~The Last Age of Eternal Darkness~
@2021 = ~This book is adorned with a strange jagged spiral. It contains numerous obscure runes, signs and words in ancient languages no longer known today. Only a few lines are written in a script and language understandable to you:
"The Finisher, the Elder Elemental Eye, the Dark God, the One Who Is Patient, the One Who Waits, the Abomination, the Father of Primordial Evil, the Author of Mischief, the Lord of Eternal Darkness, the Eater of Worlds, the Despised One, the Unhappener - these are but a few of the many names for our glorious Master. For a thousand years the dark god has waited, lurking beyond the bounds of reality, locked in a vault erected by jealous hands, its rightful throne occupied by usurpers. In recent centuries our efforts have led to destruction, decay and loss, while these lesser powers have sought to confuse, mislead and set us against each other, for you see, His release means their end. They fear him. Yes, mighty Tyr, Lathander, even sad Beshaba, they all tremble at His imminent arrival. The time has come, the end has come, and it is our sacred duty to usher in the final age of our world and bring the constructs of the false gods to ruin. Only then will we understand the perfect nature of all that is possible with the Eternal Darkness."~

Make sure that the trolls, the sirens and the hag remain in our favour. Surviving castaways must be charmed by the sirens as quickly as possible and brought by you to the other side as sacrifices. If intruders land on the island you must seal the passage so that it is not discovered. Intruders should think that a sea hag is responsible for all of this.
  So if you have to seal the passage again, do the following: 
  Destroy the shadow stone to close the secret passage. You can easily generate a new shadow stone in the ritual chamber later. Lock the door to the cellar and hide the key, preferably in your chest. Let the hag seal the tower from the outside with her foul magic. Don't forget to activate the traps in the tower! When the danger is over, you will have to perform the ritual again to get a new shadow stone. Remember that you must wear your cult helmet to see the outline of the secret door.
  Destroy this message after you have read it.

His ship's magician put some enchantments on the teeth, but even the magician could do nothing against his captain's rancid breath and ghastly appearance. The pirate was known for his booming laughter in hopeless situations, so it is not surprising that his dentures have the ability to unnerve enemies within earshot for a time.

Irphong is ours! We have landed on the island. A tribe of Sirens had taken up residence in the caves, but they swore allegiance to our dark lord after we slew two of them. They can still be useful to us. Some fools immediately went in search of treasure. As if there would be anything left of it after all the centuries the island has been uninhabited!

12 Tarsak
Doomdreamer Vergol has summoned a group of sea trolls to the island to keep pirates away. The hag has also arrived and made herself at home in the upper part of the island. We should not look at her or we will be struck by her curse of weakness. Her brew is quite useful. Most of the time she wanders the island in the form of a little girl. Everyone is desperately searching for the entrance to the other side, but we have found nothing.

20. Tarsak
We found the portal to the other side! It was there all along, right before our eyes! The old cultists took great pains to hide it from prying eyes. If you place the appropriate item in the hiding place and wear the helmet of our cult, the passageway will appear clearly before you.

1 Mirtul
The others have taken the Luminous Crystal from the socket of the lighthouse on the top floor and crossed to the other side through the portal with it. Any castaway that washes up now must be brought there by myself as a sacrifice. Every third one is for the trolls, the hag and the sirens. I am to wait here and hide. Let the ships that sail by believe that the Sea hag and the Sirens are behind it all.

3. Mirtul
Doomdreamer Vergol is still busy completing the ritual. We need more victims! The ships are avoiding the island by now, and everyone is starting to get restless....

... he calls me! At first my dreams were muddled and unclear, but now it has fallen like a shadow from my eyes. How fitting! At last our cult cell has a use. There is this lonely island, far to the west of our homeland of Chessenta. There, in ancient times, they worshipped our Lord Tharizdun. In later generations his cult was banned, and the many sacrifices offered to our Lord by the shoals off the island dried up. The fools even placed a magical lighthouse on the island to stop the Lord of Shadows. The mission our Lord gave us in my dreams is simple: remove the magical crystal of the lighthouse, unseal the ancient entrance to our Lord's plane, offer all the stranded as sacrifices to the Elder Elemental Eye, thereby desecrating the Lighthouse, and finally break the bonds that keep our God from re-entering the world.
Then, at last, the gaze of the Elder Elemental Eye, our Lord Tharizdun, will once again shroud all in eternal darkness and secure for us, his most faithful servants, a place at his side.
